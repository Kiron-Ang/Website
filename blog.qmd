### November 3, 2024, Sunday
Today, I stayed at home and worked on some homework. 
I also used ChatGPT to play a text-based adventure game.
I've been feeling mentally fatigued recently because of two complex 
situations in my life, but I feel a lot better after spending some time
yesterday with my two close research friends. The name of the bakery we
went to is "Around the World"; I loved their sweet desserts! I need to go
to HEB early tomorrow morning; I hope that the weather will stay dry.
