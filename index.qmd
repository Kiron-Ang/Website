My name is Kiron Ang, and I'm an undergraduate student at Baylor University! 
I currently live in Waco, Texas, United States. 
I plan to graduate in December 2025 with a BS in Informatics unless something goes horribly wrong.
Before moving to Waco, I lived in Mission, TX.
I was born and raised in the Rio Grande Valley.
